This microservice receives shift data and returns wage information based on a shifts.json file. Communication occurs over TCP using ZeroMQ in REQ-REP mode.

Requirements before you can use the microservice:
- pip install pyzmq

Input Requirements:
To generate a report, the microservice must receive, and expects, a shifts.json file which must be in the same directory. 

The file must contain:

General Data:
- hourlyWage: float or int
- startDate: YYYY-MM-DD
- endDate: YYYY-MM-DD

Shift Data:
- Date: YYYY-MM-DD
- Hours: Number of hours worked
- Credit Card tips: int/float
- Cash Tips: int/float
- Example:

Requesting Data
- To send a request to the microservice, ensure the microservice is running, and use the ZeroMQ REQ socket and send a string:
      socket.send_string("Generate Report")

- The microservice listens on: tcp://localhost:5555

Receiving Data
- You can receive the wage data by using: 
      message = socket.recv_json()

- If configured successfully, you will receive a JSON object, which you can format, as shown below:

    earnings = {
        "total_hours_worked": hours_worked,
        "cash_tips": round(cash_tips, 2),
        "credit_tips": round(credit_tips, 2),
        "total_tips": round(total_tips,2),
        "total_wages": round(total_wages, 2),
        "gross_earnings": round(gross_earnings, 2),
        "start_date": startDate.strftime("%Y-%m-%d"),
        "end_date": endDate.strftime("%Y-%m-%d"),
    }          

- You may also receive an error message such as:
      Error: No shifts found in the specified date range.
